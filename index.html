    <h1><i class="user icon"></i> About Me</h1>

    <p><h3>I'm Rafael Biriba, a very passionate developer, who loves to learn and create new stuff, even in my free time. Professionally working with software development since 2008 but my true passion for coding started back them in 2004.</h3></p>
    <p>I've started learning programming languages (PHP and Javascript) on my own back in 2004 when I was still in school, doing some small websites for friends and local stores. I love the idea of "if you have to do twice, automate it!‚Äù. I got so excited by creating new stuff that I decided to study this subject at the university.</p>
    <p>Learn new stuff is never a problem, is the beauty of this area, the power that we have to create, to adapt and to build software that means something, motivated by the challenge of bringing the best experience for the user/customer.</p>
    <p>Today, with almost <span class="almost_current_experience_years">14</span> years of experience, planning, developing, delivering and maintaining web application, mainly in Ruby but also familiar with different languages and technologies. During my career, I also had the opportunity to apply the agile methodology and also different development techniques and practices.</p>
    <p>My professional experiences includes the development of important and big applications with millions of users/requests per day, and this not only includes the code itself but the entire stack setup and technical decisions, which gave to me much learning of the DevOps field, using tools and frameworks to deal with setup, virtualisation and automation of the entire infrastructure.</p>
    <p>Recently in Shopify, working in a mix of a senior developer and champion of some topics, providing help the team in many ways from support, decisions, meetings, planning and technical solutions, always sharing my experiences and listening to others experiences, resulting in many learnings on my daily basis, which is awesome!</p>
